### Project Description

Safe-Sphere is a web application designed to enhance women's safety by providing real-time safety assessments of various locations. Users can input a destination and receive safety scores based on factors such as time of day, historical incident data, and user reports.

### The Problem Statement

Women often face uncertainty regarding the safety of unfamiliar areas, especially during late hours. There is a need for a tool that offers timely and accurate safety information to assist in making informed decisions about travel routes and destinations.

### The Solution

Safe-Sphere offers an interactive platform where users can enter a location and receive a safety score, along with recommendations for safer routes or times to visit. The application aggregates data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive safety assessment.
